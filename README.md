# Retail-Apparel-Company-Data-Analysis-Project
This project is based on a dataset which belongs to Retails Apparel Company , which includes Product wise Sales  details such as Invoice Number, Product Category and Customer demographics across different  Regions. 
## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Average Invoice Value: Measure the average spending per Invoice to gauge customer spending behaviour. This may also be segmented by Customer Age Group or Sales Channel, for instance.
- Rate of Returned Products: Assess the percentage of Products returned in comparison to the total number of Products sold for a specified time period and analyze possible factors contributing to Returns.
- Sales Growth by Region: Identify Regions which are performing well, and which are under performing in terms of Sales growth by comparing Region wise Sales over multiple time periods (day-to-day, for example) and 
  calculating the percentage change in Sales.
